He can no longer cast his highest level of spells (if any).</p>\n<h3>Impaired</h3>\n<p>The victim is exhausted. Whenever she takes a standard or full action, she must succeed at a Fortitude save at the disease&rsquo;s DC or lose the action and become @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated} for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} and no longer adds his mental ability score modifiers when calculating number of uses per day of abilities dependent on those scores, including bonus spells per day.

If she takes a standard action, she immediately loses 1 Hit Point.</p>\n<p>The victim begins losing his grasp on thought, reality, and self. He has a 50% chance each round to take no relevant actions, instead babbling randomly, wandering off, or talking to unseen parties.</p>\n<h3>Bedridden And Disassociated</h3>\n<p>The victim is awake and can converse, but she can&rsquo;t stand on her own or take any other actions or reactions.</p>\n<p>The victim is almost entirely disconnected from reality. His mind filters and twists all external stimuli into strange forms. He can no longer tell friend from foe and can&rsquo;t willingly accept any aid (including healing) from another creature unless he succeeds at a Will save against the disease&rsquo;s DC.</p>\n<h3>Comatose</h3>\n<p>The victim is unconscious and feverish, and can&rsquo;t be woken.</p>\n<p>A victim rendered comatose by a mental disease has lost all grip on reality and entered a dream world. He can&rsquo;t be woken.</p>\n<h3>Dead</h3>\n<p>The victim is dead, and his corpse may still be contagious.</p>",
