The DCs of his spells and special abilities decrease by an additional 2. He can no longer cast his 2 highest levels of spells (if any).</p>\n<h3>Befuddled</h3>\n<p>The victim begins losing his grasp on thought, reality, and self. He has a 50% chance each round to take no relevant actions, instead babbling randomly, wandering off, or talking to unseen parties.</p>\n<h3>Disassociated</h3>\n<p>The victim is almost entirely disconnected from reality. His mind filters and twists all external stimuli into strange forms. He can no longer tell friend from foe and can&rsquo;t willingly accept any aid (including healing) from another creature unless he succeeds at a Will save against the disease&rsquo;s DC.</p>\n<h3>Comatose</h3>\n<p>A victim rendered comatose by a mental disease has lost all grip on reality and entered a dream world. He can&rsquo;t be woken.</p>\n<h3>Dead</h3>\n<p>The victim is dead, and his corpse may still be contagious.</p>",
