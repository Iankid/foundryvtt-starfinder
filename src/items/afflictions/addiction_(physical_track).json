A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn&rsquo;t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction&rsquo;s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong>3 consecutive saves</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Physical Disease Track</h2>\n<p><strong>Healthy&mdash;Latent&mdash;Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Debilitated&mdash;Bedridden&mdash;Comatose&mdash;Dead</strong></p>\n<h3>Latent</h3>\n<p>The victim has contracted a disease.
