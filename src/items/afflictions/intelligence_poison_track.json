Page 417 explains the details of the various methods of delivery. A character who is poisoned attempts a saving throw after the listed onset and at the listed frequency thereafter. Upon initial exposure, regardless of whether she succeeds at her saving throw, the victim loses a number of Hit Points equal to the poison&rsquo;s DC &ndash; 10. If a victim is exposed to multiple doses of the same poison, she must attempt a separate save for each dose and progresses to the next state on the poison track with each failed save.</p>\n<p><em>Modifiers currently do not effect Ability DCs, as well as spellcasting limitations</em></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Intelligence Poison Track</h2>\n<p><strong>Healthy&mdash;Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Animalistic&mdash;Comatose&mdash;Dead</strong></p>\n<h3>Weakened</h3>\n<p>The victim takes a &ndash;2 penalty to all Intelligence-based ability checks and skill checks, and the DCs of her spells and special abilities decrease by 2.
