Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.<br /><br />A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.ANDdDHLnY7Dfnhtq]{Remove Radioactivity} has the same effect. As usual for poison effects, an affected creature requires rest to recover from radiation poisoning. Remove affliction doesn't cure a creature of the effects of radiation poisoning, but @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.ANDdDHLnY7Dfnhtq]{Remove Radioactivity} does.<br /><br />At each state of impaired and beyond, the victim must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or contract the radiation sickness disease<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Table 11-8: Radiation Levels</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Radiation Level</td>\n<td>Fort DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severe</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br /><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong>none</p>\n<p><em>Modifiers currently do not effect Con based DCs</em></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Constitution Poison Track</h2>\n<p><strong>Healthy&mdash;Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Debilitated&mdash;Unconscious&mdash;Dead</strong></p>\n<h3>Weakened</h3>\n<p>The victim takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and Constitution-based DCs.
